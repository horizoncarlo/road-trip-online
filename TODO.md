- TODO Bug in Firefox rendering, dice is white if moused over while rolling - fine if wiggle-dice anim is removed
- Introduction paragraph on load (don't show based on returning user, tracked in storage). Also includes a link to the rules PDF
- Tutorial mode from intro dialog - puts floating tooltips on each element and explains the rules
- Intro/tutorial accessible later via a floating ? button on the page
- Snap draggable into dice placement slot
- Would be amazing to leverage the 3D even more and have visibly stacked dice in the same slot
- Customize:
  - dice color (face, pip, border)
  - sort dice after roll or not
  - number of twirls (aka fast mode to have none)
  - start setup
- Eventually do an "auto-allocate" that places our dice for us? Since realistically when playing on tabletop an experienced player will often just do the scoring without physically placing
  - Or could just let Score button be pressed without fully drag and dropped dice? Basically work against allDice list instead of checking slots
